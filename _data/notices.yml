#           Tomorrow, February 25th, we need to perform urgent maintenance to our main storage. We don't expect a major issue except for 
#           jobs that need to access data older than 10 weeks ago. For these, it's possible to get a "no data" answer or a timeout. 
#           Everything should return to normal operation by the end of the day. 
#           
#           Sorry for the inconvenience.

#            Due to upgrade work to the de.NBI cloud infrastructure, we need to shut down most of our computing resources next April 14th and 15th, 2021. 
#            The shutdown will start at <b>17:00 CEST of April 14th</b> and everything should return to normal operation by the end of the next day.
#            We will keep the web server running, accepting jobs and workflows, but there will be a delay in processing them.
#            The running jobs, at that date, will be interrupted and rescheduled for a new start (from scratch, no intermediate results can be saved) as soon as the cloud is available again.
#            Please take it into account in your job schedule.
#            
#            Sorry for the inconvenience.
