            Want to learn the best practices for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 data using Galaxy?
            Visit the Galaxy SARS-CoV-2 portal at [covid19.galaxyproject.org](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org).
            We mirror <b>all public</b> SARS-CoV-2 data from ENA in a [Galaxy data library](https://bit.ly/usegalaxy-eu-covid19-data) for your convenience.
            The Galaxy community also created [COVID-19 related trainings](https://training.galaxyproject.org/search?query=covid19) and we also maintain a 
            [running document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ajfy3RG-BOGTSdhQUMZ0hnGtePZplv-lK0rYzx8L-vo/preview#) with recent news.
            
            If you need help to submit your data to public archives, like ENA, please get in touch. We will support you to share your data.

           The [Galaxy Training Network (GTN) Smorgasbord](https://shiltemann.github.io/global-galaxy-course/) will be running from
           Monday, February 15 through Friday, February 19 across all usegalaxy.* servers, primarily usegalaxy.org, usegalaxy.eu, and usegalaxy.org.au.
           In order to ensure adequate resources are available for the over __1,000__ students who have signed up to participate in the course,
           we have reduced the concurrent jobs each user can have. We will restore the previous settings after the training.
           All training materials (videos, slides, hands-on descriptions) will stay available and open for everyone, what else!
           Thanks to all our [trainers and supporters](https://shiltemann.github.io/global-galaxy-course/#acknowledgements)!

#           Due to upgrade work to our peta-storage we need to shutdown large parts of our compute infrastructure on the
#           30.01.2021. We are hopeful to keep the webserver running and accept jobs and workflows, but there will be a delay
#           in processing them.
