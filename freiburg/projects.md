# Galaxy and its community
---

The Freiburg Galaxy team is highly involved in many projects related to the global Galaxy community:

- Galaxy core development and maintenance.
- Tool integration into Galaxy and their maintenance through:
    - [Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC)](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/).
    - [Björn's repository](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools).
- [Galaxy Training Material](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/), a collection of Galaxy-related tutorials and its infrastructure, developed and maintained by the community.
- [Galaxy Docker](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable), to provide an easy distributable full-fledged Galaxy installation.
- Development and maintenance of different [Galaxy flavours](/about).
- Jupyter integration into Galaxy. 
- [GalaxyP](http://galaxyp.org), a Galaxy community dedicated to developing [tools](https://github.com/galaxyproteomics/tools-galaxyp), workflows and [training material](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/proteomics/) for proteomic research.
- [Galaxy Genome Annotation (GGA)](https://galaxy-genome-annotation.github.io/), a group of projects focused on supporting genome annotation inside Galaxy.

# Bioconda and BioContainers
---

Spending valuable time in compilation/installation should not be a problem nowadays. Therefore, the Freiburg Galaxy team is leading the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io) and [BioContainers](https://biocontainers.pro) projects, which together form the best stack for reproducible science ever.

Bioconda is a channel for the conda package manager specializing in bioinformatics with around 8,000 bioinformatics packages ready to use with `conda install`. 

BioContainers is an open source and community-driven framework which provides system-agnostic executable environments for bioinformatics software, with around 200,000 containers ready to use.

### de.NBI

The Freiburg Galaxy team is part of [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/), the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure, through the [RNA Bioinformatics Center](https://www.denbi.de/network/rna-bioinformatics-center-rbc). 
<a name="elixir"></a>
### ELIXIR

Via de.NBI, the Freiburg Galaxy team is also involved in [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org), as technical coordinator for the [German node](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/germany).

The Freiburg Galaxy team is also co-leading the [ELIXIR Galaxy Community](https://www.elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy), particularly with the maintenance of European Galaxy instance ([usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu)). Monthly meetings, webinars and various activities are organised around the ELIXIR Galaxy Community.

The team has participated in several [ELIXIR Implementation Studies](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/commissioned-services?combine=&field_categories_tid=1221&field_funding_sources_tid=All&field_elixir_node_target_id=All&status=All) since 2018:
- ELIXIR Implementation Study - Galaxy Community, in 2018, with a focus on setting up the newly established ELIXIR Galaxy Community
- Expanding the Galaxy: meeting (the needs of) ELIXIR Communities, 2019
- Strengthen Data Management in Galaxy, 2021
- Reference hCNV datasets, use-case workflows and benchmarking, 2021
- Beacon and beyond — Implementation-driven standards and protocols for CNV discovery and data exchange, 2021
- Deploying Reproducible Containers and Workflows Across Cloud Environments, 2021

<a name="eosc"></a>
### EOSC-Life

The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/) in particular, aims at creating an open, digital and collaborative space for biological and medical research. Galaxy is a key player in [WP2 on Tools & Workflows](https://www.eosc-life.eu/tools-workflows/) and WP7, around [Cloud Deployment](https://www.eosc-life.eu/about/work-packages/).

<a name="pari"></a>
### PaRI 

The [Pandemic Research Infrastructure (PaRI)](https://neic.no/pari/) project brings together the needs, interests and resources to create e-infrastructure to support research excellence in the Nordic region.


<a name="egi-ace"></a>
### EGI-ACE

[European Grid Infrastructure - Advanced Computing for EOSC (EGI-ACE)](https://www.egi.eu/projects/egi-ace/) is a 30-month project coordinated by the EGI Foundation with a mission to empower researchers from all disciplines to collaborate in data- and compute-intensive research through free-at-point-of-use services.

# Data Management Projects
---

<a name="biodaten"></a>
### BioDATEN

The aim of the project [BioDATEN (Bioinformatics DATa ENvironment)](https://portal.biodaten.info/) is to provide the foundation of a Science Data Centre in close cooperation with the life science communities such as research groups and infrastructure providers such as libraries and computing centres.


<a name="dataplant"></a>
### DataPLANT

The NFDI [DataPLANT](https://nfdi4plants.de/) consortium provides services to complement existing infrastructures and focuses on supporting and easing the processes of complete and meaningful research metadata management in plant sciences. 


<a name="elixir-converge"></a>
### ELIXIR-CONVERGE

[ELIXIR-CONVERGE](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/how-funded/eu-projects/converge) will deliver the provisioning, across Europe, of distributed local support for data management. This will be based on a toolkit for researchers that enables lifecycle management for their research data, in compliance with international standards.

<a name="miracum"></a>
### MIRACUM

The goal of the [MIRACUM (Medical Informatics for Research and Care in University Medicine)](https://www.miracum.org) project is to foster IT innovations for healthcare research and medical care. The goal is to take advantage of digitalization in medicine, link data and generate medical knowledge, and develop and apply innovative IT solutions for a better, data-based healthcare delivery system.

As part of the MTB (Molecular Tumor Board) use case, the Freiburg Galaxy team is developing and maintaining together with [Melanie Börries](https://www.mol-med.uni-freiburg.de/mom/boerries) the EXOM-seq pipeline in Galaxy.
