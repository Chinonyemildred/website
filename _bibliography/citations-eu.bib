	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Awakening of zygotic transcription in animal embryos relies on maternal pioneer transcription factors. The interplay of global and specific functions of these proteins remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed nucleosome positioning, H3K27 acetylation, transcription, and gastrulation rates in zebrafish embryos lacking pluripotency factors Pou5f3 and Sox19b. We show that the bulk transcriptional onset does not require Sox19b and Pou5f3, but is sensitive to their balance. Pou5f3 docks H3K27ac on the enhancers of genes involved in gastrulation and ventral fate specification. Sox19b facilitates Pou5f3 access to one-third of these enhancers. The genes regulating mesendodermal and dorsal fates are primed for activation independently on Pou5f3 and Sox19b. Strikingly, the loss of either factor results in activation of silent enhancers; simultaneous loss of both leads to premature expression of differentiation genes. Our results uncover how independent activities of maternal Pou5f3 and Sox19b add up or antagonize to determine the early gene expression repertoire.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Therefore, this study used CNV and control specimens which had been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded immediately after surgical extraction and analyzed them using a 3’ RNA sequencing approach. Transcriptome profiles were analyzed and used to estimate content of immune and stromal cells and to define disease-associated gene signatures using statistical and bioinformatic methods. We identified 158 differentially-expressed genes (DEG) that were significantly increased in CNV compared to control tissue. Cell type enrichment analysis revealed a diverse cellular landscape with an enrichment of immune and stroma cell types in CNV including endothelial cells, macrophages, T cells and NKT cells. Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated that DEG contributed to Blood Vessel Development, Extracellular Structure Organization, Response to Wounding and several immune-related terms. The S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) and S100A9 emerged among the top DEG, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry on CNV tissue and protein analysis of vitreous samples. This study provides a high-resolution RNA-sequencing-based transcriptional signature of human CNV, characterizes its compositional pattern of immune and stromal cells and reveals S100A8/A9 as a novel biomarker and promising target for AMD-directed therapeutics and diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Background
Diet induced weight loss represents an intervention for obesity to prevent associated diseases. However there is considerable inter-individual variation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and plasma miRNA might be contributing factors. We therefore hypothesized that changes in the miRNA pattern during weight loss depend on the SNP genotype.
Methods
Plasma miRNA profiles from 12 patients were determined before and after a three month weight loss intervention by Illumina sequencing. 46 further patients were analyzed by qPCR. SNP genotypes were determined on the Sequenom iPLEX platform.
Results
Samples before and after weight loss were analyzed by miRNA-seq and delta miRNA levels ranked according to p-value. Levels of miRNAs 25, 93 and 106 that are expressed from a common genomic cluster were reduced after weight loss. Those results were substantiated in a qPCR analysis of 46 additional patients. This is in accordance with mouse data showing a functional involvement of this cluster in obesity. Correlation of the changes in miRNA abundance with SNP genotypes revealed a statistical association of all three miRNAs with known obesity susceptibility SNPs.
Conclusion
Diet induced weight loss leads to SNP dependent modulation of miRNAs from the miR 25/93/106 gene cluster in humans.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09847},
	abstract = {We present a novel method for automated identification of putative cell types from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. By iteratively applying a machine learning approach to an initial clustering of gene expression profiles of a given set of cells, we simultaneously identify distinct cell groups and a weighted list of feature genes for each group. The feature genes, which are differentially expressed in the particular cell group, jointly discriminate the given cell group from other cells. Each such group of cells corresponds to a putative cell type or state, characterised by the feature genes as markers. To benchmark this approach, we use expert-annotated scRNA-seq datasets from a range of experiments, as well as comparing to existing cell annotation methods, which are all based on a pre-existing reference. We show that our method automatically identifies the 'ground truth' cell assignments with high accuracy. Moreover, our method, Single Cell Clustering Assessment Framework (SCCAF) predicts new putative biologically meaningful cell-states in published data on haematopoiesis and the human cortex. SCCAF is available as an open-source software package on GitHub (https://github.com/SCCAF/sccaf) and as a Python package index and has also been implemented as a Galaxy tool in the Human Cell Atlas.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the major causes of cancer-associated deaths worldwide, with a dismal prognosis that has not significantly changed over the last decades. Transcriptional analysis has provided valuable insights into pancreatic tumorigenesis. Specifically, pancreatic cancer subtypes were identified, characterized by specific mutations and gene expression changes associated with differences in patient survival. In addition to differentially regulated mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), were shown to have subtype-specific expression patterns. Hence, we aimed to characterize prognostic lncRNAs with deregulated expression in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which has the worst prognosis. Extensive in silico analyses followed by in vitro experiments identified long intergenic non-coding RNA 261 (LINC00261) as a downregulated lncRNA in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which is generally associated with transforming growth factor \&beta; (TGF\&beta;) signaling in human cancer cells. Its genomic neighbor, the transcription factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), regulated LINC00261 expression by direct binding of the LINC00261 promoter. CRISPR-mediated knockdown and promoter knockout validated the importance of LINC00261 in TGF\&beta;-mediated epithelial\&ndash;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and established the epithelial marker E-cadherin, an important cell adhesion protein, as a downstream target of LINC00261. Consequently, depletion of LINC00261 enhanced motility and invasiveness of PANC-1 cells in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that LINC00261 is an important tumor-suppressive lncRNA in PDAC that is involved in maintaining a pro-epithelial state associated with favorable disease outcome.},

	title = {Insights into {Alu} retrotransposons: mechanism of {Alu} transcriptome alteration in response to virus infection and novel effects on gene expression},
	shorttitle = {Insights into {Alu} retrotransposons},
	url = {http://dspace-unipr.cineca.it/handle/1889/3997},
	abstract = {A large portion of the human genome is composed of repeated sequences, with Alu retrotransposons representing the most abundant repetitive elements. Alu sequences belong to the class of the Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) and depend on the Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) for their mobilization into the genome. The efficiency of Alu amplification during primate evolution suggests a positive driving force for their accumulation, bringing up to 1 million copies in the human genome. For unclear reasons, the majority of Alu sequences is repressed by tight epigenetic silencing, which is released in response to cell stresses such as virus infection and cancer progression. Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is known to cause an increase of Alu transcription in HeLa, myelogenous leukemia and embryonic kidney cell lines, even though the virus factors that are responsible for this transcriptional enhancement have not been identified yet. Potential candidates could be represented by oncovirus proteins that induce a global remodeling of the host epigenetic landscape. For example, the Adenovirus early E1A protein interacts with the host tumor suppressor Rb, the lysine acetylase p300 and the p400 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, resulting in the induction of quiescent fibroblasts to enter the S-phase of the cell cycle. 
The exceptional success of Alu expansion and their retention even at the cost of a strong epigenetic silencing, which is released by virus infection, led us to investigate the molecular mechanism of Alus activation and their potential involvement in various cell processes.  
Firstly, genome-wide Alu profiling was performed in quiescent human primary fibroblasts infected with the Ad5 dl1500 mutant, which only expresses the oncovirus small E1A protein. A total of 1880 Polymerase III (Pol III) transcribed Alus were detected through high throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), revealing a 4-fold increase of the average Alu expression induced by small E1A.   
With the aim of identifying small E1A-host protein interactions that are crucial for the activation of Alu expression, the host proteins Rb, p300 and p400 were put under investigation. Alu expression profiling was performed in cells infected with small E1A mutants that are not capable to bind Rb, p300 or p400. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data revealed that the small E1A-p400 binding mutant was the least efficient in activating Alu expression, whereas a milder effect was reported for small E1A-Rb and small E1A-p300 binding mutants. Moreover, ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of dl1500 infected fibroblasts revealed an enrichment of H3K4me1 within the body of small E1A-induced Alus. Our data point toward the existence of H3K4me1 Alu loci that are recognized by p400 bound by small E1A, resulting in Alu transcription in response to virus infection. 
Secondly, two Alu sequences were stably overexpressed in one primary and one cancer cell line (human fibroblasts and HeLa cells, respectively) and differential gene expression in Alu-overexpressing cells was performed through RNA-seq data analysis. Among the two Alu- overexpressing fibroblast cell lines, 330 genes were detected as Differentially Expressed (DE), whereas only two genes were differentially expressed in HeLa cells. Interestingly, DE genes detected in Alu-overexpressing fibroblasts were significantly enriched in pathways belonging to cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. The promotion of cell cycle was also supported by a significantly higher percentage of cells in the S-phase compared to control samples as revealed by flow cytometry.  
The studies conducted in this work identify Ad5 small E1A as one of the virus factors that enhance Alu transcription, possibly through binding with the p400 complex. Interestingly, the overexpression of two Alu sequences in human fibroblasts leads to the stimulation of cell cycle progression, resulting in the same phenotype as previously observed in Ad5 infected fibroblasts. This brings us to speculate that the overexpression of Alu sequences during stress response to viral infection could be exploited by Ad5 to sustain cell proliferation.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other auxiliary proteins for cell entry. Recent studies have described conjunctival congestion in 0.8\% of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and there has been speculation that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the conjunctiva. However, it is currently unclear whether conjunctival epithelial cells express ACE2 and its cofactors. In this study, a total of 38 conjunctival samples from 38 patients, including 12 healthy conjunctiva, 12 melanoma, 7 squamous cell carcinoma and 7 papilloma samples, were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess mRNA expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and its cofactors including TMPRSS2, ANPEP, DPP4, and ENPEP. ACE2 protein expression was assessed in eight healthy conjunctival samples using immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is not substantially expressed in conjunctival samples on the mRNA (median 0.0 transcripts per million (TPM), min 0.0 TPM, max 1.7 TPM) and protein levels. Similar results were obtained for the transcription of other auxiliary molecules. In conclusion, this study finds no evidence for a significant expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary mediators for cell entry in conjunctival samples, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV-2 via these mediators unlikely.

However, the related molecular basis remains undetermined. Through comprehensive structural, enzymology and cellular characterization of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, we here report a multi-layered substrate-recognition mechanism underpinning their divergent genomic methylation activities. A hydrogen bond in the catalytic loop of DNMT3B causes a lower CpG specificity than DNMT3A, while the interplay of target recognition domain and homodimeric interface fine-tunes the distinct target selection between the two enzymes, with Lysine 777 of DNMT3B acting as a unique sensor of the +1 flanking base. The divergent substrate preference between DNMT3A and DNMT3B provides an explanation for site-specific epigenomic alterations seen in ICF syndrome with DNMT3B mutations. Together, this study reveals crucial and distinctive substrate-readout mechanisms of the two DNMT3 enzymes, implicative of their differential roles during development and pathogenesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing in conjunction with RNA sequencing to create an epigenomic and transcriptomic map of the developmental transition from asexual blood stages to male and female gametocytes and to ookinetes in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Across the developmental stages examined, heterochromatin protein 1 associates with variantly expressed gene families localised at subtelomeric regions and variant gene expression based on heterochromatic silencing is observed only in some genes. Conversely, the euchromatin mark histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) is abundant in non-heterochromatic regions across all developmental stages. H3K9ac presents a distinct pattern of enrichment around the start codon of ribosomal protein genes in all stages but male gametocytes. Additionally, H3K9ac occupancy positively correlates with transcript abundance in all stages but female gametocytes suggesting that transcription in this stage is independent of H3K9ac levels. This finding together with known mRNA repression in female gametocytes suggests a multilayered mechanism operating in female gametocytes in preparation for fertilization and zygote development, coinciding with parasite transition from host to vector.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we report the draft genome of soil isolate DP-K7 that has the potential to degrade methyl red. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome analysis exposed that the bacterial strain DP-K7 belongs to the species Kocuria indica. The genome annotation of the strain DP-K7 through the bioinformatics tool “Prokka” showed that the genome contains 3,010,594 bp with 69.01\% GC content. The genome comprises 57 contigs including 2 rRNA genes, 47 tRNA genes, and 2754 CDS. The plate and broth assay showed that the strain DP-K7 has the potential to utilize methyl red as the sole carbon source for growth. Indeed, the RP-HPLC analysis proved that the strain DP-K7 is capable of degrading methyl red. The genome BLAST against a characterized azoreductase (AzoB—Xenophilus azovorans KF46F) revealed the presence of two azoreductase-like genes (azoKi-1 and azoKi-2). The phylogenetic analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of characterized azoreductases suggested that AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 belong to members of the clade IV azoreductase, which are flavin-independent. The multiple sequence alignment of AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 with flavin-independent azoreductases showed the presence of NAD(P)H binding like motif (GxxGxxG). In addition, other genes coding for dye degrading enzymes (SodC, SodA, KatA, KatE, and DyP2) were also found in the genome supporting that the strain K. indica DP-K7 is a potential azo dye degrader.},

	abstract = {RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of peripheral blood can be a valuable source of information for investigating the status and mechanism of diseases. However, blood contains 50–80\% unwanted hemoglobin (Hb) transcripts. Lexogen’s QuantSeq mRNA-Seq-Kit for Illumina RNA-Seq features a ‘Globin Block’ (GB) module that depletes Hb cDNAs during library preparation. Here, we aimed to assess GB’s effectiveness and checked for technical biases attributable to GB. Using whole blood total RNA samples of 91 healthy individuals, we sequenced 91 pairs of GB and non-blocked samples (noGB) on Illumina HiSeq2500 and 8 pairs of GB/noGB technical replicates on HiSeq4000. GB reduced the fraction of Hb transcripts from 43\% (s.d. 14\%) to 8.0\% (s.d. 4.3\%). From GB samples we detected 1,397 more expressed genes at approximately 11 million reads per RNA-isolate. Enrichment and differential expression analyses did not reveal significant differences for GB and noGB samples with respect to molecular function. In contrast to results from studies that have examined the performance of GB during RNA isolation, we were able to assign GB to corresponding noGB samples (from multiple sequencing runs on HiSeq2500) with at least 89.8\% accuracy from the complete correlation matrix of all GB/GB, noGB/noGB and GB/noGB pairs. However, the use of different sequencers (HiSeq2500 vs HiSeq4000) impaired assignment of technical replicates, whereas assignment of GB to corresponding noGB samples worked perfectly when sequencing on one lane on HiSeq4000. Lexogen’s GB RNA-Seq module is a valuable addition during mRNA-Seq library preparation which works even with low amounts of input total RNA (50 ng per sample). GB facilitated the detection of low abundant transcripts and yielded more non-hemoglobin reads, while preserving biological information. We observed that differences in sequencing run and platform have a far greater effect on technical variation than the use of GB.},

Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises.

Here, double X-dosage shifts female pluripotent cells towards the naive stem cell state by increasing pluripotency factor expression, inhibiting the differentiation-promoting MAP kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and delaying differentiation. To identify the genetic basis of these sex differences, we have performed a series of CRISPR knockout screens in murine embryonic stem cells to comprehensively identify X-linked genes that cause the female pluripotency phenotype. We found multiple genes that act in concert, among which Klhl13 plays a central role. We show that this E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor protein promotes pluripotency factor expression, delays differentiation and represses MAPK target genes, and we identify putative substrates. We thus elucidate the mechanisms that drive sex-induced differences in pluripotent cells with implications for gender medicine in the context of induced pluripotent stem cell based therapies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In flowering plants, male gametes are produced in anthers, being encased in pollen grains. Understanding the genetic regulation of meiosis key events such as chromosome recognition and pairing, synapsis and recombination, is needed to manipulate chromosome associations for breeding purposes, particularly in important cereal crops like wheat. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to analyse gene expression and to validate the results obtained by other transcriptomic analyses, like RNA-seq. Selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization is essential to obtain reproducible and accurate expression data. In this work, twelve candidate reference genes were evaluated using the mainstream algorithms geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and ΔCt, then ranked from most to least suitable for normalization with RefFinder. Different sets of reference genes were recommended to normalize gene expression data in anther meiosis of bread and durum wheat, their corresponding genotypes in the absence of the Ph1 locus and for comparative studies among wheat genotypes. Comparisons between meiotic (anthers) and somatic (leaves and roots) wheat tissues were also carried out. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first comprehensive list of reference genes for robust RT-qPCR normalization to study differentially expressed genes during male meiosis in wheat in a breeding framework.},

Measuring the microbial biocontrol agent (mBCA) populations in the environment is essential for an accurate risk assessment and to optimize the usage of an mBCA-based plant protection product. In this manuscript, a workflow to obtain a large number of qPCR markers suitable for robust strain-specific detection and quantification is presented. The workflow starts from whole genome sequencing data and consists on (i) identifying the strain-specific sequences, (ii) designing specific primer/probe sets for qPCR assays, and (iii) empirically verifying the performance of the assays. The first two stages involve exclusively computer work, but they are intended for researchers with little or no bioinformatic background: only knowledge of the BLAST suite tools and working with spreadsheets are required, and familiarity with the Galaxy environment and next-generation sequencing concepts are strongly advised. All bioinformatic work can be implemented using publically available resources and a regular desktop computer, no matter the operating system, connected to the Internet. The workflow was tested with 5 bacterial strains from different species under development as mBCAs, and yielded thousands of candidate markers and a triplex qPCR assay for each candidate mBCA. The qPCR assays were successfully tested in soils of different nature, water from different sources, and samples from different plant tissues. The mBCA detection limits and population dynamics in the different matrices are similar to those in qPCR assasys designed by other means. In summary a new accessible, amenable, cost-effective and robust, workflow to obtain a large number of strain-specific qPCR markers, is presented.},

	abstract = {The large family of KRAB zinc finger (KZNF) genes are transcription factors implicated in recognizing and repressing repetitive sequences such as transposable elements (TEs) in our genome. Through successive waves of retrotransposition-mediated insertions, various classes of TEs have invaded mammalian genomes at multiple timepoints throughout evolution. Even though most of the TE classes in our genome lost the capability to retrotranspose millions of years ago, it remains elusive why the KZNFs that evolved to repress them are still retained in our genome. One hypothesis is that KZNFs become repurposed for other regulatory roles. Here, we find evidence that evolutionary changes in KZNFs provide them not only with the ability to repress TEs, but also to bind to gene promoters independent of TEs. Using KZNF binding site data in conjunction with gene expression values from the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that KZNFs have the ability to regulate gene expression in the human brain in a region-specific manner. Our analysis shows that the expression of KZNFs shows correlation with the expression of their target genes, suggesting that KZNFs have a direct influence on gene expression in the developing human brain. The extent of this regulation and the impact it has on primate brain evolution are still to be determined, but our results imply that KZNFs have become widely integrated into neuronal gene regulatory networks. Our analysis predicts that gene expression networks have been repeatedly innovated throughout primate evolution, continuously gaining new layers of gene regulation mediated by both TEs and KZNFs in our genome.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Crossroads between transposons and gene regulation’.},

A stable, in vitro cardiac endothelial cell line could provide high cell numbers as needed for many epigenetic analyses and facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in endothelial cell biology. To test their suitability for transcriptomic or epigenetic studies, we compared the transcriptome of cultured immortalized mouse cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) to primary cardiac endothelial cells (pEC). Whole transcriptome comparison of MCEC and pEC showed a correlation of 0.75–0.77. Interestingly, correlation of gene expression declined in endothelial cell-typical genes. In MCEC, we found a broad downregulation of genes that are highly expressed in pEC, including well-described markers of endothelial cell differentiation. Accordingly, systematic analysis revealed a downregulation of genes associated with typical endothelial cell functions in MCEC, while genes related to mitotic cell cycle were upregulated when compared to pEC. In conclusion, the findings from this study suggest that primary cardiac endothelial cells should preferably be used for genome-wide transcriptome or epigenome studies. The suitability of in vitro cell lines for experiments investigating single genes or signaling pathways should be carefully validated before use.},

	abstract = {Protein-RNA interactions play an important role in all post-transcriptional regulatory processes. High throughput detection of protein-RNA interactions has been facilitated by the emerging CLIP-seq (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing) techniques. Enrichments in mapped reads as well as base transitions or deletions at crosslink sites can be used to infer binding regions. Single-nucleotide resolution techniques (iCLIP and eCLIP) have been achieved by capturing high fractions of cDNAs which are truncated at protein-RNA crosslink sites. Increasing numbers of datasets and derivatives of these protocols have been published in recent years, requiring tailored computational analyses. Existing methods unfortunately do not explicitly model the specifics of truncation patterns and possible biases caused by background binding or crosslinking sequence preferences. 
We present PureCLIP, a hidden Markov model based approach, which simultaneously performs peak calling and individual crosslink site detection. It is capable of incorporating external data to correct for non-specific background signals and, for the first time, for the crosslinking biases. We devised a comprehensive evaluation based on three strategies. Firstly, we developed a workflow to simulate iCLIP data, which starts from real RNA-seq data and known binding regions and then mimics the experimental steps of the iCLIP protocol, including the generation of background signals. Secondly, we used experimental iCLIP and eCLIP datasets, using the proteins’ known predominant binding regions. And thirdly, we assessed the agreement of called sites between replicates, assuming target-specific signals are reproducible between replicates. 
On both simulated and real data, PureCLIP is consistently more precise in calling crosslink sites than other state-of-the-art methods. In particular when incorporating input control data and crosslink associated motifs (CL-motifs) PureCLIP is up to 13\% more precise than other methods and we show that it has an up to 20\% higher agreement across replicates. Moreover, our method can optionally merge called crosslink sites to binding regions based on their distance and we show that the resulting regions reflect the known binding regions with high-resolution. 
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method achieves a high precision robustly over a range of different settings and performs well for proteins with different binding characteristics. Lastly, we extended the method to include individual CLIP replicates and show that this can boost the precision even further. PureCLIP and its documenta- tion are publicly available at https://github.com/skrakau/PureCLIP.},

Targeted DNA methylation has been successfully documented by many groups for silencing selected genes, but recent publications have raised concerns regarding its specificity. In the current work, we developed new EpiEditors for programmable DNA methylation in cells with a high efficiency and improved specificity. First, we demonstrated that the catalytically deactivated Cas9 protein (dCas9)-SunTag scaffold, which has been used earlier for signal amplification, can be combined with the DNMT3A-DNMT3L single-chain effector domain, allowing for a strong methylation at the target genomic locus. We demonstrated that off-target activity of this system is mainly due to untargeted freely diffusing DNMT3A-DNMT3L subunits. Therefore, we generated several DNMT3A-DNMT3L variants containing mutations in the DNMT3A part, which reduced their endogenous DNA binding. We analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation of selected variants and confirmed a striking reduction of untargeted methylation, most pronounced for the R887E mutant. For all potential applications of targeted DNA methylation, the efficiency and specificity of the treatment are the key factors. By developing highly active targeted methylation systems with strongly improved specificity, our work contributes to future applications of this approach.},

	abstract = {Sequential developmental events, starting from the moment of fertilization, are crucial for the acquisition of animal body plan. Subtle modifications in such early events are likely to have major impacts in later morphogenesis, bringing along morphological diversification. Here, comparing the blind cave and the surface morphotypes of Astyanax mexicanus fish, we found heterochronies during gastrulation that produce organizer and axial mesoderm tissues with different properties (including differences in the expression of dkk1b) that may have contributed to cavefish brain evolution. These variations observed during gastrulation depend fully on maternal factors. The developmental evolution of retinal morphogenesis and hypothalamic patterning are among those traits that retained significant maternal influence at larval stages. Transcriptomic analysis of fertilized eggs from both morphotypes and reciprocal F1 hybrids showed a strong and specific maternal signature. Our work strongly suggests that maternal effect genes and developmental heterochronies that occur during gastrulation have impacted morphological brain change during cavefish evolution.},

The Malpighian tubules (MTs) and hindgut constitute the functional kidney of insects. MTs are outpouchings of the gut and in most insects demonstrate proximodistal heterogeneity in function. In most insects, such heterogeneity is confined to ion/fluid secretion in the distal portion and ion/fluid reabsorption in the proximal portion. In contrast, MTs of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars of butterflies and moths) are composed of five regions that differ in their association with the gut, their structure and ion/fluid transport function. Recent studies have shown that several regions can rapidly and reversibly switch between ion secretion and reabsorption. The present study employed RNAseq, pharmacology and electrophysiology to characterize four distinct regions of the MT in larval Trichoplusia ni. Luminal microelectrode measurements indicate changes in [K+], [Na+] and pH as fluid passes through different regions of the tubule. In addition, the regions examined differ in gene ontology enrichment, and demonstrate robust gradients in expression of ion transporters and endocrine ligand receptors. Lastly, the study provides evidence for direct involvement of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in epithelial ion transport of insect MTs.},

Methods: The study population included 49 consecutive patients treated for OSCC. Oral brushing sample collection was performed at two different times: before any cancer treatment in the tumor mass and during patient follow-up almost 6 months after OSCC treatment, within the regenerative area after OSCC resection. Each sample was considered positive or negative in relation to a predefined cut-off value. Results: Before any cancer treatment, 47/49 specimens exceeded the score and were considered as positive. Six months after OSCC resection, 16/49 specimens also had positive scores in the samples collected from the regenerative area. During the follow-up period, 7/49 patients developed locoregional relapse: 6/7 patients had a positive score in the regenerative area after OSCC resection. The presence of a positive score after oral cancer treatment was the most powerful variable related to the appearance of locoregional relapse. Conclusion: 13-gene DNA methylation analysis by oral brushing may have a clinical application as a prognostic non-invasive tool in the follow-up of patients surgically treated for OSCC.},

These pipelines, also known as workflows, can be complex and difficult to create from thousands of tools, especially for researchers new to Galaxy. To make creating workflows easier, faster and less error-prone, a predictive system is developed to recommend tools facilitating further analysis. A model is created to recommend tools by analysing workflows, composed by researchers on the European Galaxy server, using a deep learning approach. The higher-order dependencies in workflows, represented as directed acyclic graphs, are learned by training a gated recurrent units (GRU) neural network, a variant of a recurrent neural network (RNN). The weights of tools used in the neural network training are derived from their usage frequencies over a period of time. The hyper-parameters of the neural network are optimised using Bayesian optimisation. An accuracy of 97\% in predicting tools is achieved by the model for precision@1, precision@2 and precision@3 metrics. It is accessed by a Galaxy API to recommend tools in real-time. Multiple user interface (UI) integrations on the server communicate with this API to apprise researchers of these recommended tools interactively.},

In addition, bioinformatics analysis is becoming increasingly complex and convoluted, involving multiple algorithms and tools. A wide variety of methods and software tools have been developed for computational proteomics and metabolomics during recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. However, most of the computational proteomics and metabolomics tools are designed as single-tiered software application where the analytics tasks can't be distributed, limiting the scalability and reproducibility of the data analysis. In this paper we summarise the key steps of metabolomics and proteomics data processing, including the main tools and software used to perform the data analysis. We discuss the combination of software containers with workflows environments for large scale metabolomics and proteomics analysis.

Heterozygous mutations in genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF complex have been reported in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), with the majority of the mutations in \textit{ARID1B}. CSS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by facial dysmorphisms, digital anomalies, and variable intellectual disability. We hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding subunits of the ubiquitously expressed SWI/SNF complex may lead to alterations of the nucleosome profiles in different cell types. We performed the first study on CSS-patient samples and investigated the nucleosome landscapes of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from blood plasma by whole-genome sequencing. In addition, we studied the nucleosome landscapes of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes from CSS-affected individuals by nucleosome occupancy and methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) as well as their expression profiles. In cfDNA of CSS-affected individuals with heterozygous \textit{ARID1B} mutations, we did not observe major changes in the nucleosome profile around transcription start sites. In CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes, we found few genomic regions with different nucleosome occupancy when compared to controls. RNA-seq analysis of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes of these individuals detected only few differentially expressed genes, which were not in proximity to any of the identified differential nucleosome-depleted regions. In conclusion, we show that heterozygous mutations in the human SWI/SNF subunit ARID1B do not have a major impact on the nucleosome landscape or gene expression in blood cells. This might be due to functional redundancy, cell-type specificity, or alternative functions of ARID1B.},

Methods: Fifteen HIV-1 strains were processed with Direct RNA Sequencing (SQK-RNA002) library kits and sequenced on MinION Mk1B devices with RevD flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). Raw reads were converted to FASTQ, aligned to reference sequences, and assembled into contigs. Multi-sequence alignments of the contigs were generated and used for cladistics analysis. Results: We sequenced full-length HIV-1 from the transcriptional start site to 39 LTR (100\% virion genome) in 3 out of 15 isolates (89.6, NLAD8, AD17), achieving majority coverage (defined as \&gt; 50\%) in another 7 out of 15 isolates. Inspection of NLAD8 sequence alignments revealed splicing or deletion signatures. Despite the strong 3′ bias, read coverage was sufficient to evaluate single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions in 9 isolates, and to assemble HIV-1 genomes directly from viral RNA, achieving a maximum of 94\% assembly coverage for NLAD8. Phylogenetic relationships were maintained at the level of contigs, as well as individual reads. Conclusions: ONT native RNA sequencing performed as expected, covering full-length HIV-1 RNA without PCR or cDNA sequencing. Native single-molecule RNA sequencing supported previous models of HIV-1 replication, and samples exhibited strain-specific transcriptional signals. We propose Context Dependency Variant Classification to describe variants occurring in information-dense regions of HIV. These data provide a rich resource for emerging RNA modification detection schemes. Future work will expand HIV-1 transcript profiling to infection models and clinical samples.},

	url = {https://harvest.usask.ca/handle/10388/12429},
	abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate pesticide used extensively in Canada and around the world. Due to its highly conserved mechanism of action involving inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), CPF has the ability to exert toxicity on non-target species in aquatic systems. In fish species, exposure to CPF has been associated with a range of adverse effects across physiological endpoints including abnormal development, inhibition of AChE, immunomodulation, and molecular level effects such as altered expression of specific genes and global transcriptomes. However, the literature on amphibians exposed to CPF is not as extensive despite the known global declines of amphibian species and the hypothesized links between these declines and anthropogenic pesticide contamination of aquatic systems worldwide. The overall objective of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the sub-lethal effects of CPF exposure on the model amphibian, Xenopus laevis, across levels of biological organization from molecular to whole animal. 
The first study (Chapter 2) examined the molecular toxicity pathways and mechanisms of toxicity after short-term exposure of early life-stage (ELS) X. laevis to CPF using whole body transcriptome analyses. The ELS transcriptomic responses were then compared to apical outcomes of chronic exposure to CPF to determine if identified dysregulated pathways could provide early indicators of these adverse outcomes. Post-hatch individuals were exposed to nominal CPF concentrations of 0.4, 2, or 10 μg L-1. A subset of individuals were sampled at 96 hours (h) for whole-body transcriptomic analysis and remaining individuals were transferred to tanks for long-term exposure through to metamorphic climax ({\textasciitilde} 75 days). Pathway analysis revealed dysregulated pathways that were related to outcomes known to be associated with exposure to CPF such as altered serine hydrolase activity, impacted metabolic processes, and immune-related outcomes. Other dysregulated pathways with less precedence in the literature included vasculature development and sensory perception of light stimulus. Apical outcomes of chronic CPF exposure included inhibition of AChE activity, increased relative liver weight, and a decrease in percentage of individuals that reached metamorphic climax. Dysregulation of serine hydrolase associated pathways after ELS CPF exposure is in agreeance with the decrease in AChE (a serine hydrolase enzyme) activity observed in the brains of individuals at metamorphic climax. Additionally, an increase in relative liver weight after chronic CPF exposure could be related to dysregulation of ELS pathways associated with metabolic processes and immune function. In fact, several pathways related to immune function were depleted.
In Chapter 3, we more closely examined the potential immunotoxicity of sub-lethal CPF exposure. Post-metamorphic individuals were exposed 1 or 10 μg L-1 CPF (nominal) for 7 days (d), then administered a phosphate buffered sodium (PBS) control injection or a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to stimulate an inflammatory response. At 24 h post-injection, morphometric indices were recorded and tissues were sampled for differential leukocyte counts (flow cytometry), liver pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (qPCR), and kidney histopathology. At 1 µg L−1 CPF, there was a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, an increase in circulating granulocytes, and an increase in the granulocyte:lymphocyte (GL) ratio regardless of immune state. Liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and CSF-1 was increased in individuals exposed to 10 µg L−1 CPF, independent of immune state. Exposure to 10 μg L-1 CPF increased kidney epithelial cell height (by 18 \%) and decreased lumen space in the convoluted tubules of the kidney. This study provided evidence that exposure to CPF can lead to changes in key biomarkers of immune status in amphibians in both immune-rested (PBS-injected) and immune-stimulated (LPS-injected) states. Additionally, we found that LPS was an effective mitogen in our study, capable of inducing a robust and measurable stress response in X. laevis. This response included a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, and increase in circulating monocytes, and an increase in the GL ratio. In addition, increased liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and CSF-1 was induced by LPS injection. We conclude that LPS is an appropriate immunostimulatory agent in an immune challenge assay using X. laevis and that exposure to CPF does not appear to impact the response to LPS exposure. 
Overall, our findings show that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of CPF has the ability to impact amphibians at multiple levels of biological organization. A number of affected molecular pathways warrant further study in terms of the underlying mechanisms of CPF-mediated toxicity as well as the associated outcomes of CPF exposure in amphibians. This research provides novel data on the effects of CPF exposure to amphibians, which are generally overlooked and under-represented in the literature despite links between pesticide exposure and globally declining amphibian populations.},

To reveal its genetic variation and population structure, microsatellite markers were developed and validated in four Greek populations. Methods and Results RNA-Seq data of the related species Arnebia euchroma and Echium plantagineum were assembled and mined to identify conserved ortholog sets containing simple sequence repeat motifs. Fifty potential loci were identified and then tested on A. tinctoria, of which 17 loci were polymorphic. The number of alleles ranged from one to nine, and the levels of observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.000 to 1.000 and 0.000 to 0.820, respectively. Most of these loci could be successfully amplified in eight other species of Boraginaceae (Alkanna graeca, A. hellenica, A. sfikasiana, Echium vulgare, E. plantagineum, Lithospermum officinale, Borago officinalis, and Anchusa officinalis). Conclusions This study provides the first set of microsatellite loci for studying the genetic variation and population structure of A. tinctoria and shows their potential usefulness in other Boraginaceae species.},

Identification of the core microbiome by metagenome analysis and prediction of functional characteristics are essential to make microalgal feedstock more sustainable and economically feasible. Biogas production from photoautotrophically grown Chlorella vulgaris (Ch. vulgaris) biomass (240 mL CH4 g oTS-1) and co-fermentation with maize silage (330 mL CH4 g oTS-1) has been studied in semi continuous laboratory biogas fermenters.

The microbial community and the read-based functional profiles, derived from these data, were examined during the process by using next-generation metagenome Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The read-based core microbiome consisted of 92 genera from which 60 abundant taxa were directly associated with the microbial methane producing food chain. The data-set was also analyzed in a genome-based approach. 65 bins were assembled, 52 of them belonged in the core biogas producing genera identified by the read-based metagenomes. The read-based and genome-based approaches complemented and verified each other. The functional profiles indicated a variety of glycoside hydrolases. Substantial rearrangements of the methanogen functions have also been observed. Co-fermentation of algal biomass and plant biomass can be carried out for an extended period of time without process failure. The microbial members of the inoculum are well conserved, feedstock composition cause relative abundance changes in the core microbiome.},

Impaired regeneration and remodeling of mucociliary epithelia are associated with dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in chronic airway diseases, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive, and studies yield seemingly contradicting results. Employing the Xenopus mucociliary epidermis, the mouse airway, and human airway Basal cells, we characterize the evolutionarily conserved roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vertebrates. In multiciliated cells, Wnt is required for cilia formation during differentiation. In Basal cells, Wnt prevents specification of epithelial cell types by activating ΔN-TP63, a master transcription factor, which is necessary and sufficient to mediate the Wnt-induced inhibition of specification and is required to retain Basal cells during development. Chronic Wnt activation leads to remodeling and Basal cell hyperplasia, which are reversible in vivo and in vitro, suggesting Wnt inhibition as a treatment option in chronic lung diseases. Our work provides important insights into mucociliary signaling, development, and disease.},

The conserved motifs of these sRNAs are nearly complementary to each other, suggesting their ability to participate in crosstalk. The conserved motif of Yfr1 is shared by members of the Yfr10 sRNA family, members of which are otherwise less conserved in sequence, structure, and synteny compared to Yfr1. The different structural properties enable the discrimination of unique targets of Yfr1 and Yfr10. Unlike most studied regulatory sRNAs, Yfr1 gene expression only slightly changes under the tested stress conditions and is present at high levels at all times. In contrast, cellular levels of Yfr10 increase during the course of acclimation to darkness, and levels of Yfr2 increase when cells are shifted to high light or nitrogen limitation conditions. In this study, we investigated the targetomes of Yfr2, Yfr1, and Yfr10 in Prochlorococcus MED4, establishing CRAFD-Seq as a new method for identifying direct targets of these sRNAs that is applicable to all bacteria, including those that are not amenable to genetic modification. The results suggest that these sRNAs are integrated within a regulatory network of unprecedented complexity in the adjustment of carbon and nitrogen-related primary metabolism.},

The roadmap is the result of a workshop titled “An intrinsically disordered protein user community proposal for ELIXIR” held at the University of Padua. The workshop, and further consultation with the members of the wider IDP community, identified the key priority areas for the roadmap including the development of standards for data annotation, storage and dissemination; integration of IDP data into the ELIXIR Core Data Resources; and the creation of benchmarking criteria for IDP-related software. Here, we discuss these areas of priority, how they can be implemented in cooperation with the ELIXIR platforms, and their connections to existing ELIXIR Communities and international consortia.

Here, we report a cooperative binding of U2AF65 and the related protein CAPERα to the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. In addition, we show that the RS domain of U2AF65 drives a liquid?liquid phase separation that is amplified by intronic RNA with repeated pyrimidine tracts. In cells, knockdown of either U2AF65 or CAPERα improves the inclusion of cassette exons that are preceded by such repeated pyrimidine-rich motifs. These results support a model in which liquid-like assemblies of U2AF65 and CAPERα on repetitive pyrimidine-rich RNA sequences are driven by their RS domains, and facilitate the recruitment of the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. We anticipate that posttranslational modifications and proteins recruited in dynamical U2AF65 and CAPERα condensates may further contribute to the complex mechanisms leading to specific splice site choice that occurs in cells.},

Here, we identify the transcription factors Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as novel regulators of alveolar macrophages (AMs)?a population that provides the first line of immune defense and executes homeostatic functions in lung alveoli. In the absence of these factors, AMs exhibited decreased proliferation that resulted in a severe disadvantage of knockout AMs in a competitive setting. Gene expression analyses revealed a broad cell-intrinsic footprint of Bhlhe40/Bhlhe41 deficiency manifested by a downregulation of AM signature genes and induction of signature genes of other macrophage lineages. Genome-wide characterization of Bhlhe40 DNA binding suggested that these transcription factors directly repress the expression of lineage-inappropriate genes in AMs. Taken together, these results identify Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as key regulators of AM self-renewal and guardians of their identity.},

	abstract = {C-type lectin-like domain containing proteins (CTLDcps) mainly bind carbohydrate-based ligands, but also other ligands. CTLDcps are involved in several biological processes including cell adhesion, cell-cell interactions, and pathogen recognition. Pathogen recognition by myeloid cells, e.g. dendritic cells (DCs), can be facilitated through cell surface expressed CTLDcps. Cell surface expressed CTLDcps have been exploited in vaccine designs for specific targeting of human and mouse DCs using antibodies. In recent years, however, DC targeting using carbohydrate-based vaccines has gained interest due to low production cost, limited immunogenicity, and possibility of multivalent adjustment. In chicken, however, only a few CTLDcps have been identified. Identifying and annotating additional chicken CTLDcps (chCTLDcps) is needed to exploit carbohydrate-mediated DC targeting in chicken. Therefore, we searched the chicken GRCg6a assembly for novel chCTLDcps. We identified 28 chCTLDcps of which 10 had previously been described and also experimentally validated. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR confirmed mRNA expression of the remaining 18 identified chCTLDcps. A group of highly related chCTLDcps, moreover, was shown to be avian-specific and comprise novel members mapped to the proposed chicken natural killer gene complex. Two chCTLDcps, chCLEC17AL-A and chCLEC17AL-B, were found to share a recent common ancestor with CLEC17A. Putative mannose or fucose-binding sequence motifs, EPN and WND, were found in the CTLD of chCLEC17AL-A. Both contained intracellular internalisation and signalling sequence motifs. In conclusion, several chCTLDcps were identified and their expression confirmed. Both chCLEC17AL-A and -B showed promise as potential targets in carbohydrate-based chicken vaccine strategies. Determination of DC-specific expression of chCLEC17AL-A and -B, thus, might prove useful in chicken vaccinology.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with compositional and functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, but specific contributions of individual bacteria to chronic intestinal inflammation remain unclear. Enterococcus faecalis is a resident member of the human intestinal core microbiota that has been linked to the pathogenesis of IBD and induces chronic colitis in susceptible monoassociated IL-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice. In this study, we characterized the colitogenic activity of E. faecalis as part of a simplified human microbial consortium based on seven enteric bacterial strains (SIHUMI). RNA sequencing analysis of E. faecalis isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10-/- mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the ethanolamine utilization (eut) locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of eut genes, deletion of ethanolamine utilization (∆eutVW) had no impact on E. faecalis colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10-/- mice. However, replacement of the E. faecalis wild type bacteria by a ∆eutVW mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10-/- mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of E. faecalis ethanolamine utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand E. faecalis gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type E. faecalis cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10-/- mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms E. faecalis gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in E. faecalis monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of E. faecalis genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking E. faecalis enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that E. faecalis ethanolamine metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis towards a protective function.},

These novel proteins were found encoded either within non-coding RNAs, 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, or overlapping a known coding sequence (CDS) in an alternative ORF. OpenProt is the first database that enforces a polycistronic model for eukaryotic genomes, allowing annotation of multiple ORFs per transcript. OpenProt is freely accessible and offers custom downloads of protein sequences across 10 species. Using OpenProt database for proteomic experiments enables novel proteins discovery and highlights the polycistronic nature of eukaryotic genes. The size of OpenProt database (all predicted proteins) is substantial and need be taken in account for the analysis. However, with appropriate false discovery rate (FDR) settings or the use of a restricted OpenProt database, users will gain a more realistic view of the proteomic landscape.

High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed large variation in the bacterial community structure and diversity throughout the years but also allowed to discriminate an environment effect on community assembly. Partial drivers for this environment effect on composition can be correlated with the huge differences in ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) and black carbon on the leaves. A change in bacterial community composition was noted for trees growing in the city centre compared to the natural site, and also more human-associated genera were found colonising the leaves from the city centre. These integrated results offer an original and first insight in the Platanus phyllomicrobiota, which can offer new opportunities to use phyllosphere microorganisms to enhance air pollution degradation.},

	abstract = {Nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) are a large and diverse group of fungi, which may switch from a saprotrophic to a predatory livestyle if nematodes are present. Different fungi have developed different trapping devices, ranging from adhesive cells to constricting rings. After trapping, fungal hyphae penetrate the worm, secrete lytic enzymes and form a hyphal network inside the body. We sequenced the genome of Duddingtonia flagrans, a biotechnologically important NTF used to control nematode populations in fields. The 36.64 Mb genome encodes 9,927 putative proteins, among which are more than 638 predicted secreted proteins. Most secreted proteins are lytic enzymes, but more than 200 were classified as small secreted proteins ({\textless} 300 amino acids). 117 putative effector proteins were predicted, suggesting interkingdom communication during the colonization. As a first step to analyze the function of such proteins or other phenomena at the molecular level, we developed a transformation system, established the fluorescent proteins GFP and mCherry, adapted an assay to monitor protein secretion, and established gene-deletion protocols using homologous recombination or CRISPR/Cas9. One putative effector protein, PefB, was transcriptionally induced during the interaction. We show that the mature protein is able to be imported into nuclei in C. elegans cells. In addition, we studied trap formation and show that cell-to-cell communication is required for ring closure. The availability of the genome sequence and the establishment of many molecular tools will open new avenues to studying this biotechnologically relevant nematode-trapping fungus.},

The Baltic Sea is infamous for its annual cyanobacterial blooms comprised of Nodularia spumigena, Aphanizomenon spp., and Dolichospermum spp. that cause harm, especially for recreational users. To broaden our knowledge of the cyanobacterial adaptation strategies for brackish water environments, we sequenced the entire genome of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, a species occurring not only in freshwater environments but also in brackish water. Comparative genomics analyses revealed a close association with Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0090 isolated from a lake in Finland. The genome closure of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315 unraveled a mixture of two subtypes in the original culture, and subtypes exhibited distinct buoyancy phenotypes. Salinity less than 3 g L−1 NaCl enabled proper growth of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, whereas growth was arrested at moderate salinity (6 g L−1 NaCl). The concentrations of toxins, microcystins, increased at moderate salinity, whereas RNA sequencing data implied that Dolichospermum remodeled its primary metabolism in unfavorable high salinity. Based on our results, the predicted salinity decrease in the Baltic Sea may favor toxic blooms of Dolichospermum spp.},

	abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important uropathogen that increasingly harbors broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance determinants. Evidence suggests that some same-strain recurrences in women with frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) may emanate from a persistent intravesicular reservoir. Our objective was to analyze K. pneumoniae isolates collected over weeks from multiple body sites of a single patient with recurrent UTI in order to track ordered strain progression across body sites, as has been employed across patients in outbreak settings. Whole-genome sequencing of 26 K. pneumoniae isolates was performed utilizing the Illumina platform. PacBio sequencing was used to create a refined reference genome of the original urinary isolate (TOP52). Sequence variation was evaluated by comparing the 26 isolate sequences to the reference genome sequence. Whole-genome sequencing of the K. pneumoniae isolates from six different body sites of this patient with recurrent UTI demonstrated 100\% chromosomal sequence identity of the isolates, with only a small P2 plasmid deletion in a minority of isolates. No single nucleotide variants were detected. The complete absence of single-nucleotide variants from 26 K. pneumoniae isolates from multiple body sites collected over weeks from a patient with recurrent UTI suggests that, unlike in an outbreak situation with strains collected from numerous patients, other methods are necessary to discern strain progression within a single host over a relatively short time frame.},

	abstract = {DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) approved for older AML patients are clinically tested in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). The mechanism of action of these drugs is still under debate. In colon cancer cells, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) can downregulate oncogenes and metabolic genes by reversing gene body DNA methylation, thus implicating gene body methylation as a novel drug target. We asked whether DAC-induced gene body demethylation in AML cells is also associated with gene repression, and whether the latter is enhanced by HDACi. Transcriptome analyses revealed that a combined treatment with DAC and the HDACi panobinostat or valproic acid affected significantly more transcripts than the sum of the genes regulated by either treatment alone, demonstrating a quantitative synergistic effect on genome-wide expression in U937 cells. This effect was particularly striking for downregulated genes. Integrative methylome and transcriptome analyses showed that a massive downregulation of genes, including oncogenes (e.g., MYC) and epigenetic modifiers (e.g., KDM2B, SUV39H1) often overexpressed in cancer, was associated predominantly with gene body DNA demethylation and changes in acH3K9/27. These findings have implications for the mechanism of action of combined epigenetic treatments, and for a better understanding of responses in trials where this approach is clinically tested.},

The key feature of our system is that it is not a static but a continuously improved collection of tutorials. By coupling tutorials with a web-based analysis framework, biomedical researchers can learn by performing computation themselves through a web browser without the need to install software or search for example datasets. Our ultimate goal is to expand the breadth of training materials to include fundamental statistical and data science topics and to precipitate a complete re-engineering of undergraduate and graduate curricula in life sciences.

This work identifies the challenges for reproducible RNA analysis, and highlights best practices on the processing and dissemination of scientific results.

This leads us to a detailed presentation of the RNA workbench, a community effort for sharing workflows and processing tools, built on top of the Galaxy framework. Here, we follow the community guidelines to extend its portfolio of RNA tools with the integration of the TriplexRNA (https://triplexrna.org).

These results reveal potential post-transcriptional regulation, providing researchers with important new insights into underlying biological and pathological disease mechanisms.

As a solution, we have developed the QuanTP software within the Galaxy platform. The software offers a suite of tools and functionalities critical for proteo-transcriptomics, including statistical algorithms for assessing the correlation between single transcript–protein pairs as well as across two cohorts, outlier identification and clustering, along with a diverse set of results visualizations. It is compatible with analyses of results from single experiment data or from a two-cohort comparison of aggregated replicate experiments. The tool is available in the Galaxy Tool Shed through a cloud-based instance and a Docker container.

However, mutations in FOXG1 cause a less frequent form of atypical Rett syndrome, called FOXG1 syndrome. FOXG1 is a key transcription factor crucial for forebrain development, where it maintains the balance between progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Using genome-wide small RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics, we identified that FOXG1 affects the biogenesis of miR200b/a/429 and interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, DDX5/p68. Both FOXG1 and DDX5 associate with the microprocessor complex, whereby DDX5 recruits FOXG1 to DROSHA. RNA-Seq analyses of Foxg1cre/+ hippocampi and N2a cells overexpressing miR200 family members identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit (PRKAR2B) as a target of miR200 in neural cells. PRKAR2B inhibits postsynaptic functions by attenuating protein kinase A (PKA) activity; thus, increased PRKAR2B levels may contribute to neuronal dysfunctions in FOXG1 syndrome. Our data suggest that FOXG1 regulates PRKAR2B expression both on transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.},

Conditional knockout of Dot1l in mouse cerebellar granule cells (Dot1l-cKOAtoh1) led to a smaller external granular layer with fewer precursors of granule neurons. Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 mice had impaired proliferation and differentiation of granular progenitors, which resulted in a smaller cerebellum. Mutant mice showed mild ataxia in motor behavior tests. In contrast, Purkinje cell-specific conditional knockout mice showed no obvious phenotype. Genome-wide transcription analysis of Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 cerebella using microarrays revealed changes in genes that function in cell cycle, cell migration, axon guidance, and metabolism. To identify direct DOT1L target genes, we used genome-wide profiling of H3K79me2 and transcriptional analysis. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DR) and differentially expressed genes (DE) revealed in total 12 putative DOT1L target genes in Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 affecting signaling (Tnfaip8l3, B3galt5), transcription (Otx1), cell migration and axon guidance (Sema4a, Sema5a, Robo1), cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Lss, Cyp51), cell cycle (Cdkn1a), calcium-dependent cell-adhesion or exocytosis (Pcdh17, Cadps2), and unknown function (Fam174b).
