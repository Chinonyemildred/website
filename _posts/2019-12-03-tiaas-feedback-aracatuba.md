Hi [Galaxy team](https://galaxyproject.eu/freiburg/)!

Just a quick message to let you know that TIaaS worked perfectly.
[We](https://www.international.unesp.br) had no problem running the analyses and experienced very minor delays only.
Thanks to you and your team, also for uploading the Bos genome. 

I am attaching a picture of the smiling workshop participants.

Sincerely,
Giovanni
