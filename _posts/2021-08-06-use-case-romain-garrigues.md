[__Romain Garrigues__](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/romain-garrigues/) is doing a PhD on plant research at the [Department of Biology, University of Antwerp (Belgium)](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/departments/biology/). Thank you Romain!


> Galaxy is useful for my work because I am doing metadata analysis of RNA sequencing based on the different climatic conditions and different plant models. With the same parameters, I will be able to continue to work and achieve step by steps goal of my PhD.
