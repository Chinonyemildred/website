Artificial intelligence (machine learning and deep learning) algorithms are being increasingly applied in several fields of Bioinformatics such as drug-response 
and protein structure prediction, imputing missing data in single-cell gene expression and many more. To harness the potential and versatility of AI’s algorithms, 
it becomes of utmost importance to deeply understand its algorithms while applying them to biological datasets for predictive tasks. Galaxy’s ML toolkit provides many popular AI algorithms 
from Scikit-learn, a popular Python ML library and Keras, a deep learning library based on Google’s Tensorflow, and various other tools for preprocessing and 
visualization.

To make experiments with science without doing hands-on would be incomplete. To mitigate this gap, several ready-to-use tutorials have been written as part of [Galaxy training 
materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/). In addition, to make them easier to understand, a collection of selected tutorials has been compiled spanning various
machine and deep learning algorithms and have been recorded showcasing the tutorials. These videos can be conveniently watched [online](https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/modules/machine-learning).
There are three categories of tutorials starting with a few easy, introductory tutorials such as classification and regression and then moving on to complex ones 
that include deep learning. In each tutorial, you will find videos along with their respective captions in English, links to their slides and tutorial. 
Moreover, online support in the form of Slack and Gitter is also available for asking questions directly to the respective tutors.

We thank Helena Rasche, Saskia Hiltemann, Fotis Psomopoulos, Kaivan Kamali and all other involved people for putting together a great, convenient, informative webpage, 
videos, captions and many more.
