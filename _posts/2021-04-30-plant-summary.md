We thank the Galaxy community for their support during the [__Plant Transcriptome Analysis using Galaxy__](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y5MqYmMxFCy7PDImYYuHLhgCKVV7MjoGMr22G2U68Ec/preview) workshop that took place online in the week of the 19th of April. The workshop offered a complete crash-course in Galaxy, and built towards __miRNA and single-cell RNA topics__ that were tailored for _Arabidopsis_ genomes.

## Plants flavour

A [__special Galaxy flavour__ of the European Galaxy Server](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2020/12/28/subdomains/) was set up for this workshop, filtering the tools by their relevance in the plants research field and accessible at:

## Format

To better empower those who require more flexible time constraints, the workshop was designed in an asynchronous manner: recordings and tutorials were made available online for the participants to consume at their own pace. After the workshop, the __tutorials will stay available in the GTN and the recordings on the [Galaxy Project YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoMMZPbz1L9AZzvIvrvqYA)__.

During the training week, __experts from different time zones were available in chat__ to answer the questions. A huge shout out to all of them for the support!

## Participation

Participants attended from __all over the globe__, enabled by the flexible learning resources provided, with a particular interest in the RNA-based tutorials available in the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/). 

The registration was over 460 participants and close to 200 participants were available in chat.

## Feedback

Despite the limitations of the online setting, the videos on YouTube were also popular with ample views.

The response so far has been overwhelmingly positive, with feedback snippets such as:

* “Overall comment: great job! Given the difficult times we are living in, this was great!”
* (The best thing about this workshop is) “that you could do everything at your own pace, some days I had lab work but I could still start in the afternoon or evening. This was very nice.”
* “The tutorial text and the videos are great. Each one complements the other. The galaxy platform was friendly too. I can remember the commands / tools lesson by lesson. Also, the availability of the materials after the workshop is great!!”
