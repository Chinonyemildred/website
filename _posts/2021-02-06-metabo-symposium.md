More than 20 researchers with diverse backgrounds participated in the virtual Galaxy Metabolomics Mini-Symposium.
The presentations covered diverse metabolomics applications and analysis tools and their past, ongoing or future integration into the Galaxy framework. 
Slides and notes of the Symposium can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V7hQN11-v3BJCwTMGMtDCjA4Gl403g99). 
In addition there were two discussion rounds about the user and tool developer aspects of Galaxy Metabolomics. 
We identified potential overlaps in tool development and user satisfaction and agreed to have a Galaxy metabolomics call every two months.

The next meetings are planned for March 11, May 6 and at the Galaxy community conference.
