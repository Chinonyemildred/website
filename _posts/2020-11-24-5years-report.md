Many things have changed since we started the Galaxy server at the University of Freiburg a few years back. This [__report__](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qZjFADy3opMM5l6nEAMMeYzdf2gpBVCD0Kgglo8ZFj4/preview#) gives an overview of the different scientific and infrastructure projects in which the team is (or has been) involved, the local and international training activities, teaching at the University of Freiburg, different events organised, publications, citations, the recent research on COVID-19 and our vision and outlook for the next years.

Big thanks to the Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg and all the other projects that have made this possible!
