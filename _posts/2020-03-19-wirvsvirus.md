We want to encourage you to participate and join the fight against Covid-19.

The Federal Government of Germany is organising the [#WirVsVirus Hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/) and the GalaxyProject is here to help.

Have a look at https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/ for an initial analysis of COVID-19 data using Galaxy, BioConda and public research infrastructure (XSEDE, de.NBI-cloud, ARDC cloud).

The Galaxy Comunity offers instances for [RStudio](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/galaxy-ui/tutorials/rstudio/tutorial.html) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/galaxy-ui/tutorials/galaxy-intro-jupyter/tutorial.html). Feel free to [contact us](galaxy@informatik.uni-freiburg.de) for further information or if we can support your research with our infrastructure.

Stay healthy!
