We will be hosting a single-cell RNA-seq training workshop in Galaxy, on both July 17th and July 19th for BCC 2020. The workshop follows the 10x-driven workflows as outlined in our preprint '[A single-cell RNA-seq Training and Analysis Suite using the Galaxy Framework](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.06.137570v3){:target="_blank"}', and will be given by members of the European Galaxy Team (Mehmet Tekman and Björn Grüning) and the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (Hans-Rudolf Hotz).

Registrations are still accepted at the [BCC website](https://bcc2020.github.io/Registration/) (early registration ends on July 10th) and prices start at $3 per training.

## Abstract

The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows and trainings that not only enable users to perform one-click 10x preprocessing, but also empowers them to demultiplex raw sequencing data manually. The downstream analysis supports a wide range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal and clustering. The teaching resources cover an assortment of different concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the [singlecell.usegalaxy.eu](https://singlecell.usegalaxy.eu) portal.
