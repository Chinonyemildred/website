November 29 will see the next global climate strike and this time The Freiburg
Galaxy Team is going to express its support more directly:

The team will be striking like last time but, in addition, **we will not
schedule new jobs on the European Galaxy server for the whole day**.

We will not interrupt running jobs so, to some extent, you should be able to
work around this service interruption.

Again, we encourage all of you to join one of the huge number of strikes
[that will be taking place world-wide](https://fridaysforfuture.org/statistics/map?d=2019-11-29) on this day!
