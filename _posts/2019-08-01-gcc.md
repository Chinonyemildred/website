The 2019 [Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019) was held in Freiburg, Germany, 1-8 July.
There was one day of training, three days of mixed meeting and training, and then two to four days of CollaborationFest.
The meeting featured joint & parallel sessions; invited, accepted, and lightning talks; [poster](https://gcc2019.sched.com/overview/type/C.+Posters+%2F+Demos+%2F+Sponsors/Posters) and [demo](https://gcc2019.sched.com/overview/type/C.+Posters+%2F+Demos+%2F+Sponsors/Demos) sessions;
[birds-of-a-feather](https://gcc2019.sched.com/overview/type/D.+Break+%2F+Social+%2F+Networking+%2F+Meal/BoFs) meetups; [social events](https://gcc2019.sched.com/overview/type/D.+Break+%2F+Social+%2F+Networking+%2F+Meal); and training sessions every day.

With 231 participants, GCC2019 was the largest GCC ever with 39 Galaxy training courses, 65 talks, 54 posters,
13 demos and more than 30 different BoFs. Our participants came from 27 different countries of Eastern- and Western Europe,
North America, Asia, Oceania and Sub-saharan Africa.

GCC2019 has started on [Monday](https://gcc2019.sched.com/2019-07-01/overview), 1st July, with a dedicated training day for Galaxy beginners offering a user-centric track with [“Introduction to using Galaxy”](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/Lud9/introduction-to-using-galaxy-galaxy-101) in parallel to the [“Introduction to Galaxy Administration”](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/LudC/introduction-to-galaxy-administration-i). Participants interested in long read sequencing and some wet-lab work could visit and try the [Nanopore loading zone](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/QZzb/nanopore-loading-zone) where the Oxford Nanopore MinION was presented. In the evening, the first Birds-of-a-Feather (BoFs) were offered for special interest groups on Single Cell data analysis, Genome Annotation and Computational Chemistry.

GCC2019 was officially opened on [Tuesday](https://gcc2019.sched.com/2019-07-02/overview), 2nd July, by Björn Grüning and Anika Erxleben. One of our Galaxy power users, Claudia Isabelle Keller Valsecchi, was invited to present her impressive data on [“Evolution of X chromosome recognition during Drosophila Dosage Compensation"](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSGJ/invited-talk-evolution-of-x-chromosome-recognition-during-drosophila-dosage-compensation#). After several talks on [Galaxy Australia](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSGM/galaxy-australia-inside-the-national-vision-of-a-data-commons), [Machine learning](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSGP/a-machine-learning-tool-suite-for-galaxy), and [Galaxy Workflows](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSGS/an-update-on-galaxy-workflows-more-accessible-expressive-robust-and-scalable), talks and workshops were offered in two tracks, one more user-driven, the other more admin-related. Galaxy is used in various fields of research, as we heard e.g. from Anne Fouilloux talking about [Climate analysis](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSGY/climate-analysis-with-galaxy) with Galaxy. During the afternoon break, the participants could discover interesting Galaxy projects in the poster and demo session. The Epigenetics sessions showed how to perform [16S analysis with mothur](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/Luez/16s-analysis-with-mothur), [ChIPseq data analysis](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/Lue7/chip-seq-data-analysis) and [HiC data analysis](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/LueP/hi-c-analysis). Beside [multi-omics](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/LufH/metatranscriptomics-and-multi-omics-functional-microbiome-analysis) data analysis in Galaxy, the first time [Machine learning](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/MDTA/machine-learning-with-galaxy-predict-age-from-rna-seq-dataset) with Galaxy was presented.

![Schedule Tuesday](/assets/media/gcc2019/sched_tue.png)

[Wednesday](https://gcc2019.sched.com/2019-07-03/overview) was dedicated to transcriptomics and genomics data analysis on the Galaxy user track. Very obvious was the demand on single cell RNA-seq data analysis as presented by [Mehmet](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSeu/single-cell-rna-analysis-in-galaxy-on-10x-datasets), [Christophe](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSex/biology-driven-classification-of-single-cells-rnaseq-data-in-galaxy), and [Jonathan](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSfF/galaxy-container-for-hinxton-single-cell-interactive-analysis-portal-hisciap). Running Galaxy for annotation with e.g. [Apollo](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSfO/visual-refinement-of-genome-annotations-with-apollo-in-a-community-environment), [G-ONRamp](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSfR/architectural-and-systems-improvements-to-g-onramp-a-collaborative-eukaryotic-genome-annotation-platform), [ChiRA](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSfU/chira-an-integrated-framework-for-chimeric-read-annotation) or on [Kybernetes](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/LufN/running-galaxy-on-kubernetes) was successfully shown in talks, posters, trainings and demos. Before the conference dinner, a public science project was presented by the [Street Science Community](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSfv/street-science-community-make-science-tangible-accessible-by-bringing-it-to-the-street-with-open-science-workshops). More than 150 people joined us for the conference dinner in [Augustiner im Bankepeter](http://www.augustiner-freiburg.de). We spent an amazing evening in the beer garden with our friends and colleagues. Thank you to all!

Proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, and variant calling data analysis were presented on [Thursday](https://gcc2019.sched.com/2019-07-04/overview/) in various talks, workshops, demos and posters, such as [microbiome](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSqT/metaproteomics-powered-by-metatranscriptomics-towards-a-multi-omic-functional-microbiome-analysis-within-galaxy) data, [ProteoRE](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSqZ/proteore-a-galaxy-based-platform-for-the-annotation-and-the-interpretation-of-proteomics-data-in-biomedical-research), [IRIDA](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSqu/the-irida-platform-for-microbial-genomics), and [Workflow4Metabolomics](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSqr/workflow4metabolomics-an-international-computing-infrastructure-for-metabolomics). With [Galaxy-E](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSq5/invited-talk-data-visualisation-by-citizen-science-participants-the-case-of-birds-and-bats-monitoring-schemes-and-galaxy-e) Yvan brought us our “Wonderful World” a bit closer. He presented the Galaxy Ecology project with newly established dedicated Galaxy [subdomain](https://ecology.usegalaxy.eu). Before closing the conference, Bérénice gave an update on the [Galaxy training network](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/PSrC/galaxy-and-training-2019-updates-from-the-galaxy-training-network). 
The GCC2019 core conference days were followed by 4 days of [CollaborationFest](https://gcc2019.sched.com/event/Luga/collaborationfest-core). During these 4 days around 100 people were working on e.g. library enhancements, Galaxy packages,
development of an ATAC-seq tutorial, create backend and frontend for select parameters in workflows, tool menu style, EDAM in Galaxy, Training development kit, and on a lot of work on usegalaxy.*.
