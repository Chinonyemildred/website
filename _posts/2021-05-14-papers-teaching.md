Two hand-in-hand teaching papers have been published this week using Galaxy as a teaching platform. The common frame encompassing both is the effects of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. University lessons and workshop have been forced to move to an online setting. 

The [first manuscript](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008922), a review, sets the ground for bioinformatics teaching during the lockdown, proposing constructivism as an appropriate methodology for students to learn in an online context.

The [second manuscript](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008923#sec003) describes how Galaxy can facilitate online teaching using the Galaxy Training Network materials, Training Infrastructure as a Service and many features such as data, history and workflow sharing, with a concrete proposed format to make the most of your training events.
