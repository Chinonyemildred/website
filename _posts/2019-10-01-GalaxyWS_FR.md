From 23.-27.09.2019, the Freiburg Galaxy Team gave a [5-days workshop on high-throughput data analysis with Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.eu/event/2019-05-08-GalaxyHTS.Freiburg.September2019/)

Our 30 participants came from Germany, Netherlands, and Italy and were mainly wet-lab scientists.

Besides a Galaxy introduction, we taught ChIP-seq data analysis, RNA-seq data analysi, HiC data analysis, and Methylation data analysis with the help of Dr. Ralf Gilsbach from the Pharmacology department and Leily Rabbani and Devon Ryan from the MPI in Freiburg.

Based on the nice feedback we received, the 30 participants and all instuctors enjoyed this workshop.
We thank all participants for attending and all lecturers and helpers for this wonderful workshop.
