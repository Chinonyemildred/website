Thanks Anzhela Migur and team for sharing your recent work about the temperature-regulated DEAD-box RNA helicase CrhR interactome.

_Abstract_ - RNA helicases play crucial roles in RNA biology. In plants, RNA helicases are encoded by large gene families,
performing roles in abiotic stress responses, development, the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, as well as housekeeping functions. Several of these RNA helicases are targeted to the organelles, the mitochondria and chloroplasts.
Cyanobacteria are the direct evolutionary ancestors of plant chloroplasts. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 encodes a single DEAD-box RNA helicase,
CrhR, that is induced by a range of abiotic stresses, including low temperature. Though the Î”crhR mutant exhibits a severe cold-sensitive phenotype, the
physiological function(s) performed by CrhR have not been described. To identify transcripts interacting with CrhR, we performed RNA co-immunoprecipitation
with extracts from a Synechocystis crhR deletion mutant expressing the FLAG-tagged native CrhR or a K57A mutated version with an
anticipated enhanced RNA binding. The composition of the interactome was strikingly biased towards photosynthesis-associated and
redox-controlled transcripts. A transcript highly enriched in all experiments was the crhR mRNA, suggesting an autoregulatory molecular
mechanism. The identified interactome explains the described physiological role of CrhR in response to the redox poise of the
photosynthetic electron transport chain and characterizes CrhR as an enzyme with a diverse range of transcripts as molecular targets.
