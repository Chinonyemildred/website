We are one out of six German [de.NBI cloud](www.denbi.de/cloud) centers that provides storage and computing resources for the life science community. Thanks to a new de.NBI grant, the European Galaxy Server now has 2000 CPU cores, 20 TB RAM, and 1,5 PB of storage.

More information about the de.NBI cloud can be found [here](https://www.denbi.de/cloud).
