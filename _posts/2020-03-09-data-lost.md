title: Data lost
---

We have unfortunately recently experienced some data loss. We believe data created in the last two months was mostly affected.

If your data was affected by this, the datasets will still appear in your history, but the data itself will be missing - i.e. if you click on the 'View' or 'Download' buttons, you will probably encounter an error.

If you try and run a job using one of the affected datasets, the job will fail with an error like 'Job 7225486's output dataset(s) could not be read'.

We are working on dealing with the situation and will publish more information later today. If you have any questions, feel free to email us at galaxy@informatik.uni-freiburg.de.
