Effectively monitoring global infectious disease crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires capacity to generate and analyze large volumes of sequencing data in near real time. These data have proven essential for monitoring the emergence and spread of new variants, and for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of the virus. The Galaxy community has developed [high-quality analysis workflows for SARS-CoV-2 analysis](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/genomics/global_platform/). The new tutorial ["Mutation calling, viral genome reconstruction and lineage/clade assignment from SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data"](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/sars-cov-2-variant-discovery/tutorial.html) will teach you how to obtain, run and combine these workflows appropriately for different types of input data.
