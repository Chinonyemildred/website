<br>
The Galaxy community is undergoing an __organizational transformation__, with the main focus on improving our global coordination in different areas by defining [__Working Groups__](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/). 

The Working Groups are __distributed across the globe__ and diverse in the topics covered  (admin, backend, UI/UX...). Although their initial definition is set, they might be refined over time.

Each working group has the __autonomy__ to organize themselves internally and it's responsible for the __definition of goals__ in each quarter of the year. The goals, together with the input from the community, will be incorporated into the __community roadmap__.

The Working Groups provide __entry points__ into the community for new members, will __improve the communication__ between experts and will help with __channelling the contributions__. 

This new organization has been discussed in two Developer Roundtables (second recording soon to be available) and the ELIXIR-Galaxy community has been informed in the monthly meetings.
