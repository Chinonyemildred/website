In the next days we will attend our yearly de.NBI SAB meeting. Time to look at some statistics.

There are now **12,300 Galaxy users** on https://usegalaxy.eu; you all have run **6,900,000** jobs
on the European Galaxy server, and created **13,300,000** datasets! 

Let's play a little bit with the numbers. We are running approximately 250,000 jobs a month.
This means 8,300 jobs per day, 350 jobs per hour, 6 per minute. Or we can rephrase it to
"**every 11 seconds finishes one job in Galaxy**". With approximately 1500 active users a month
(user that have submitted at least one job) this also means that on average each of them executes 166 jobs a month.

This success would not be possible without the support of [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/), [ELIXIR](http://elixir-europe.org/), [EOSC-life](https://www.eosc-portal.eu/eosc-life) and the Freiburg [Faculty of Medicine](http://www.med.uni-freiburg.de).

A big thank you to all our users and to everyone that has contributed to this project! Special thanks to our partner sites [Erasmus MC](https://galaxyproject.eu/erasmusmc/), [Belgium](https://galaxyproject.eu//belgium/), [GenOuest](https://www.genouest.org), [Pasteur](https://galaxyproject.eu/pasteur/) and the whole [Galaxy community](https://galaxyproject.org/community/).

As usual, nearly realtime statistics can be found on our 
[stats-server](https://stats.galaxyproject.eu/d/000000012/galaxy-user-statistics).
