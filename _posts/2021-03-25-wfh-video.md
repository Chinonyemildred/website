In the [last Galaxy release, 21.01](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_21.01/releases/21.01_announce_user.html#remote-files), access to remote files was included. Thanks to the [Workflow Hub](https://workflowhub.eu/), it is also possible to import a workflow directly into Galaxy and run it.

Putting these two features together, we have created a video showcasing the process for COVID-19 data analysis:

1. Search in the Workflow Hub and retrieve a Galaxy workflow.
2. Import it easily into Galaxy.
3. Get remote COVID-19 data into your Galaxy history.
4. Run the imported workflow on the remote data. 

You can see how it works in practice in the following video:
