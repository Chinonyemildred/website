<p>The <a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-viz-with-volcanoplot/tutorial.html">Volcano plot</a> tutorial introduced volcano plots and showed how they can be easily generated with the Galaxy Volcano plot tool. This new tutorial shows how you can customise a plot using the R script output from the tool and RStudio in Galaxy. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dspgiwkuxk">short video</a> for the tutorial is also available on YouTube, created for the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/">GCC2021 Training week</a>. 
Happy plotting!</p>
