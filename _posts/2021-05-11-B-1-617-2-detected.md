With B.1.617.2 (one of the Indian lineages) now being a Variant Of Concern (VOC), we checked the COG-UK data that we have been analyzing to
see whether we'd find representative samples. [ERR5749239](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR5749239) is clearly one of them.
The Galaxy history with this data is here https://usegalaxy.eu/histories/view?id=8f40d62f763c7d12
The report by sample can be obtained from this Galaxy [dataset](https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33a7d64e518c57e6180/display?to_ext=tabular)
and contains lots of quite unique signature mutations (compared also the by variant report in that same history).
 
We have added the corresponding VOC profile to our [Observable dashboard](https://observablehq.com/@spond/sars-cov-2-cog-uk)
and are now tracking this variant as well. Five more samples have been found already as we wrote this post.
Check every day for new data from COG-UK! We expect more samples with this signature to show up as this VOC now enters the UK :-(


### other tipps

* you can also download an SVG figure (160MB) of the entire batch here: https://usegalaxy.eu/datasets/11ac94870d0bb33aca844508c6c7a320/display?to_ext=svg
* since the [observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@spond/sars-cov-2-cog-uk) is interactive you can add your own signatures to the live dashboard
