__Amir Sabbaghian__ is using Galaxy at the [Advance Technologies Faculty, Golestan University of Medical Sciences Campus (Iran)](https://goums.ac.ir/index.php?slc_lang=en&sid=100) for colorectal cancer research. Thank you Amir to share your work with us and congratulations on your upcoming publications!
 

> Evaluation of miRNAs with the least fluctuations in the blood of normal people (_in silico_) and their comparison in patients with colorectal cancer and control. The topic is about designing miRNA based panel to detect colorectal cancer in very early stages which now is in qPCR step to validating our results.
Previous studies were similar analysis in Pancreatic cancer which has no lab work and just _in silico_. Other projects (soon to be published):
> 1. PI3k/Akt is the main pathway of cisplatin resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (Dr. Memar)
> 2. Profiling pseudogenes with the least oscillation in the blood of healthy individual's compare to their blood of breast cancer patients (Mr. Ramezanian)
> 3. Transcriptomics Profiling with the least oscillation in the blood of healthy individual's compare to their blood of breast cancer patients (Mis Ahmadi)
> 4. Network and pathway based drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment (Mis Mirmohammadi)
