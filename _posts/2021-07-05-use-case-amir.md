__Amir Sabbaghian__ is using Galaxy at the [Advance Technologies Faculty, Golestan University of Medical Sciences Campus (Iran)](https://goums.ac.ir/index.php?slc_lang=en&sid=100) for colorectal cancer research. Thank you Amir for sharing your work with us!
 
Description of the project: 

> Evaluation of miRNAs with the least fluctuations in the blood of normal people (_in silico_) and their comparison in patients with colorectal cancer and control. The topic is about designing miRNA based panel to detect colorectal cancer in the very early stages which now is in qPCR step to validate our results.
Previous studies were similar analyses in pancreatic cancer without wet lab work, just _in silico_. Other projects (soon to be published) are:
> 1. PI3k/Akt is the main pathway of cisplatin resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (Dr Memar).
> 2. Profiling pseudogenes with the least oscillation in the blood of healthy individual's compared to the blood of breast cancer patients (Mr Ramezanian).
> 3. Transcriptomics profiling with the least oscillation in the blood of healthy individuals compared to their blood of breast cancer patients (Ms Ahmadi).
> 4. Network and pathway-based drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment (Ms Mirmohammadi).
