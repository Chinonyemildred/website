We are happy to announce the publication of **pyGenomeTracks (PGT)** in Bioinformatics. The tool plots combinations of genomic tracks in a modular way and it's [available in the ToolShed](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/pygenometracks/pygenomeTracks/3.5). Many thanks to all the authors for the great effort!

## Abstract

**Motivation**: Generating publication ready plots to display multiple genomic tracks can pose a serious challenge. Making desirable and accurate figures requires considerable effort. This is usually done by hand or by using a vector graphic software.

**Results**: pyGenomeTracks (PGT) is a modular plotting tool that easily combines multiple tracks. It enables a reproducible and standardized generation of highly customizable and publication ready images.

**Availability**: PGT is available through a graphical interface on https://usegalaxy.eu and through the command line. It is provided on conda via the bioconda channel, on pip and it is openly developed on github: https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks.

**Supplementary information**: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.
