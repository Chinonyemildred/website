The first call of the Galaxy Metabolomics Community will be held on the __10th of December at 2 PM CET__. 

The bi-monthly community calls aim at bringing together Galaxy metabolomics researchers -including users and developers- to discuss about needs, ideas, scientific problems and to find new collaborators and synergies in the community. Everyone is welcome!
