[C3S User Learning Services](https://climate.copernicus.eu/user-learning-services) offers a high-quality blended training, consisting of free online learning resources and a face-to-face training session on the use of climate data to develop climate services for adaptation challenges.

The Copernicus [Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home) (CDS) is a database providing quality assured and free of charge climate information. In the CDS catalogue an extensive collection of climate datasets is available. In addition, an online toolbox allows users to build workflows and applications suited to their needs.

The blended training event focuses on helping the participants to develop a climate service using a climate adaptation case study.

## Program

The blended training approach is based on self-paced learning supported by online resources available on the Learning Experience Platform and on a face to face session which encourages the practical application of the acquired knowledge on a climate change adaptation case study. Two online webinars organised in February and March 2020 are an integral part of the training event. The face to face event will be in Oslo.

- **First webinar**: 19th of February, 10:00- 11:15h (local time) - Introduction to the blended training approach
- Self-paced study and completion of assignments (10 hours)
- **Full day face-to-face event**: 6th of March, (Oslo) – Flipped classroom (review your learning), hands-on practical activities, development of a climate change adaptation case study
- Self-paced study and further elaboration of the climate adaptation case study (8 hours)
- **Final webinar**: 27th of March, 10:00-11:30h (local time) - Presentation of case studies, discussion, and questions and answers session

Here is an overview of the program during the face to face event, Friday 6th of March 2020, 08.30h – 18.00h
