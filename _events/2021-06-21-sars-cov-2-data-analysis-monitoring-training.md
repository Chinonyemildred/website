The goal of this workshop is to build capacity in SARS-CoV-2 data analysis and data management, including data submission to ENA. After the workshop, all participants will be able to upload viral sequencing data, call all variants, create a variety of reports and create consensus alignments.

It will be a 4-day event introducing scalable and reproducible SARS-CoV-2 data analysis with Galaxy. The sessions will be pre-recorded and provided in advance. During the workshop, there will be live support in chat and live Q&A sessions, in which experts will answer questions.

# Logistics

## Content delivery

This is a global workshop delivered asynchronously. In practice, this means that you will have training materials available to explore them at **your own pace**, without any time constraints:

- Lectures: pre-recorded videos with the theoretical explanation of the lesson.
- Hands-on: a step-by-step explanation of the tutorials.
- Histories: Galaxy history with all that you need to reproduce what is shown in the hands-on part.
- Tutorials: it includes all the required information to perform the data analysis.

Most of these are available already, and they will all stay available after the workshop. All the recordings have manually-curated captions in English.

## Communication channels

Should you have any questions, the instructors will be available in chat. We will use the Slack space of the Galaxy Training Network. Depending on your location you might need to use a VPN, so **please make sure that you can join Slack before the workshop**.

<!-- Once you are in, you will see channels with the prefix 'day', followed by a number indicating the day, and another number indicating the order of the session. You will also see 'general', 'random', 'social'. Pass by and say hi to your colleagues! -->

During the week of the workshop, the instructors will be there to reply to your questions. Please be aware of the **time zones**, the instructors are scattered all over the world and sometimes you may have to be patient to get a reply.

## Technical requirements

You don't need a specific operating system or software installed, all you need is a browser and internet connection.

To do the hands-on on your own, you will need a **Galaxy account**. Please register at [https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu).

You will receive an email to confirm your account before you can start using Galaxy.

## Certificates

If you need a certificate, you can request it at the end of the workshop. Please make sure to keep all the work over the 4 days, stay active in the discussions and fill out the final survey that we will send around.

# Code of Conduct

Everyone is expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct (CoC)](https://galaxyproject.org/community/coc/) to make this environment welcoming and friendly for everyone.
