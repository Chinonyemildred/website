# Goals

The purpose of this workshop is to build capacity in COVID-19 data analysis and data management, including data submission to ENA. After the workshop, all participants will be able to upload SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data, call all variants, create a variety of reports and create consensus alignments.

# Target audience

The target audience includes **clinicians** and **researchers** that deal with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data.

# Practical information

It will be a **4-day event** introducing scalable and reproducible SARS-CoV-2 data analysis with Galaxy. The **sessions will be pre-recorded and provided in advance**. During the workshop, there will be **live support in chat**, in which experts will answer questions on a peer-to-peer basis. We will make use of the [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu) and the [Galaxy Training Material](https://training.galaxyproject.org). Both will stay accessible and open after the training.

In summary:
- **When**: August 09-12, 2021
- **Who**: Open for everybody but the target audience is **clinicians** and **researchers** that deal with SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data
- **Cost**: Free
- **Format**: Virtual and asynchronous. All training **sessions will be pre-recorded and provided in advance**.
- **Support**:
    - **Live support in chat** (Slack Channel), in which experts will answer questions on a peer-to-peer basis
    - Real-Time QA session (every day at 16.00 CEST)
- **Infrastructure**: [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu) and the [Galaxy Training Material](https://training.galaxyproject.org). Both will stay accessible and open after the training.

# Logistics

## Content delivery

This is a global workshop delivered asynchronously. In practice, this means that you will have training materials available to explore them at **your own pace**, without any time constraints:

- Lectures: pre-recorded videos with the theoretical explanation of the lesson.
- Hands-on: a step-by-step explanation of the tutorials.
- Histories: Galaxy history with all that you need to reproduce what is shown in the hands-on part.
- Tutorials: it includes all the required information to perform the data analysis.

Most of these are available already, and they will all stay available after the workshop. All the recordings have manually-curated captions in English.

## Communication channels

Should you have any questions, the instructors will be available in chat. We will use the Slack space of the Galaxy Training Network. Depending on your location you might need to use a VPN, so **please make sure that you can join slack before the workshop**. You can do it now through this link.

Once you are in, you will see channels with the prefix 'day', followed by a number indicating the day, and another number indicating the order of the session. You will also see 'general', 'random', 'social'. Pass by and say hi to your colleagues!

During the week of the workshop, the instructors will be there to reply to your questions. Please be aware of the **time zones**, the instructors are scattered all over the world and sometimes you may have to be patient to get a reply.

## Technical requirements

You don't need a specific operating system or software installed, all you need is a browser and internet connection.

To do the hands-on on your own, you will need a **Galaxy account**. Please register at [https://usegalaxy.eu)(https://usegalaxy.eu)

You will receive an email to confirm your account before you can start using Galaxy.

# Code of Conduct
