**Machine Learning in Bioinformatics using Galaxy Workshop at ISCB-LA SoIBio BioNetMX 2020**

**26th October 2020, 15:00-23:00 CEST** 

**Description:**
This workshop will be a one-day event, including six sessions and during which we will train researchers to use Galaxy for machine learning analysis. The first session will provide an introduction to Galaxy. Galaxy is a scientific platform that helps scientists to analyse data without any programming skills. To analyse data, workflows can be created to make the analyses reproducible and shareable. In the second session, basic concepts in machine learning will be introduced. The next three sessions will serve as a hands-one sessions to follow training tutorials with case studies to see how classification algorithms, regression models and unsupervised learning methods in Galaxy can be used to solve real-world problems. In the last session, we will introduce feature selection and hyper parameter optimization methods in Galaxy and the workshop will be summing up at the end.

**Learning objectives:**

* By the end of the workshop attendees will be able to:
* Introducing the basic concepts in ML and understanding the taxonomy of ML algorithms
* Understanding differences between supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms categories and which kind of problem they can be applied to
* Introducing the typically used machine learning algorithms
* Understanding different applications of ML in different case studies
* Learning how to tune the parameters of ML algorithms Learning how to use Galaxy’s machine learning tools

**Target audience:**
This workshop is aimed towards scientists active in Bioinformatics (graduate students and researchers) that are interested in applying machine learning to analyze them using Galaxy.
