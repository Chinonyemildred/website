This is a followup to discussion to the December 2020 roundtable, where Galaxy Working Groups were launched. Galaxy Working Groups are a major shift in how Galaxy Project work and direction are managed. This call will be a followup to see how our first month has gone, and how goal setting and tracking fro 2021Q1 is going.
