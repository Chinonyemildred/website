The 'Pilot Core Unit for Bioinformatics, Data Integration und Analysis (CUBiDA)' organizes a monthly colloquium with an aim of facilitating the exchange of scientific knowledge in the area of molecular and clinical data analysis. At the same time, these seminars provide a platform for networking among researchers from different disciplines within UKER/FAU. This colloquium is also supported by the graduate program Life@FAU (https://www.life.fau.eu/). The next talk will be on Thursday, 24.06.2021 at 15:30 hrs:

- Title: Introduction to Galaxy - a web-based platform for bioinformatics analysis
- Speaker: Dr. Pooja Gupta
- Abstract: Galaxy is an open source web-based platform for performing high-throughput bioinformatics analysis of large datasets in the fields such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and imaging. It makes computational analysis accessible to users lacking programming experience by enabling the usage of tools and workflows through a graphical user interface. During this talk, I will introduce the Galaxy workbench and provide a short tutorial showing how to perform basic tasks such as importing data, running tools, working with histories, creating workflows, and sharing your work.
