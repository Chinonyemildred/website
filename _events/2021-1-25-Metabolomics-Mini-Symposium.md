Galaxy metabolomics researchers and join discussions about the perspectives, interests and needs of Galaxy 
users and tool developers. In addition to a thematic exchange we hope that this event will foster new 
collaborations and synergies and integrate new researchers into the Galaxy metabolomics community.
