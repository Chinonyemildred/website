Paper cuts are annoying but easy to fix bugs. We plan to have a one-day contribution fest, dedicated to reducing Paper cuts in Galaxy and its ecosystem. It will be a **24-hours event to span all time zones** with our worldwide community. 

Please save the date! It's an ideal opportunity for newcomers to get started. And remember it's still [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!
