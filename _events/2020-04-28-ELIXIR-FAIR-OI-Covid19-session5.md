**Galaxy-ELIXIR Webinar Series: FAIR data and Open Infrastructures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic**

The Galaxy Community and ELIXIR organise a [webinar series](https://elixir-europe.org/events/webinar-galaxy-elixir-covid19) to demonstrate how open software and public research infrastructures can be used in analysing and publishing SARS-CoV2 data.

## Session 5: Behind the scenes - Global Open Infrastructures at work 

28 May 2020, **17.00-18.00 CEST** (starts at **16.00 BST**, **11.00 EDT**, **8.00 PDT**)

This session will guide the participants how they can use the Galaxy compute capacities to run their own analysis. It will present the Pulsar network that connects data centres and High Performance Computing clusters to share their computation power in support of the Galaxy Europe users and provide examples of how to submit an analysis job from the user’s perspective.
