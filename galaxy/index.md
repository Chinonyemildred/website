<b>James Taylor (1979-2020) believed that scientific progress can best be sustained through the mentoring of students and junior faculty.</b>

<br/>
<br/>

To ensure implementation of this vision, the Galaxy community has established a foundationâ€”Junior Training and Educational Connections Hotspot (JTech).
JTech's mission is to (1) assist graduate students to participate in computational biology and data science conferences,
and (2) organize and host mentoring sessions between senior and junior faculty members at high-profile meetings.
<br/>
<br/>
To make this happen we are accepting contributions. More details can be found on <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/jxtx/">the @jxtx page in the Galaxy Hub</a>.
Please, help us continue what James has started.
