# Welcome to covid19.usegalaxy.eu

This subdomain of covid19.usegalaxy.eu is devoted to research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has recently been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

This subdomain servers as a companion to our study describing the analysis of early COVID-19 data, the goal of which is to underscore the importance of access to raw data and demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid reproducible research during global crises.

This subdomain contains the exact versions of all software used.
