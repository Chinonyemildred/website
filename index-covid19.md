# Welcome to covid19.usegalaxy.eu

This subdomain of covid19.usegalaxy.eu is devoted to research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has recently been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.

This subdomain servers as a companion to our study describing the analysis of early COVID-19 data, the goal of which is to underscore the importance of access to raw data and demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid reproducible research during global crises.

This subdomain contains the exact versions of all software used.

Our analysis was divided into six parts listed below. Each part has a dedicated page that provides links to input datasets, intermediate and final results, workflows, and Galaxy histories that list all details for each analysis. These workflows can be re-run on this subdomain.

  1. [Pre-processing of raw read data](1-PreProcessing)
  2. [Assembly of SARS-CoV-2 genome](2-Assembly)
  3. [Estimation of timing for most recent common ancestor (MRCA)](3-MRCA)
  4. [Analysis of variation within individual isolates](4-Variation)
  5. [Analysis of Spike protein substitutions](5-S-analysis)
  6. [Analysis of recombination and selection](6-RecombinationSelection)

In addition we will be looking at newly released data here &#8594; [Updates: Analysis of additional data](updates)
